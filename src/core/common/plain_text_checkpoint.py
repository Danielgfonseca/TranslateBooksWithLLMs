"""Checkpoint plumbing shared by the EPUB and DOCX Plain Text Mode adapters.

Plain Text Mode has no persistence format of its own: it reuses the
``XHTMLTranslationState`` partial-state machinery that the placeholder pipeline
already writes through ``CheckpointManager``. The two adapters only differ in
where the paragraph count and the file identifier come from, so the resume
guard, the state builder and the completion delete live here rather than being
duplicated on both sides.

The ``plain_text_mode`` marker written into ``doc_metadata`` is what keeps the
two persistence users apart: a placeholder-mode state (whose chunks carry
``local_tag_map`` / ``global_indices`` and real placeholders) must never be
replayed through the plain pipeline, and vice versa.
